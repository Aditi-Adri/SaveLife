## 🛠 Tech Stack

### Frontend
| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **React** | 19 | UI component framework |
| **Vite** | 8 | Build tool & dev server |
| **Leaflet** | 1.9.4 | Interactive donor & hospital maps |
| **jsPDF** | 4.2 | Client-side donation certificate generation |
| **Pure CSS** | — | Custom CSS with CSS variables (no UI framework) |

### Backend
| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Node.js** | ≥ 20 | Runtime (ES Modules) |
| **Express** | 4 | REST API framework |
| **PostgreSQL** | — | Relational database |
| **pg** | 8.12 | PostgreSQL client |
| **bcryptjs** | 2.4 | Password hashing |
| **jsonwebtoken** | 9 | JWT authentication |
| **Nodemailer** | 9 | Email via Gmail SMTP |
| **Multer** | 2 | File uploads (avatars, documents, reports) |
| **Morgan** | 1.10 | HTTP request logging |
| **dotenv** | 16 | Environment variable management |
| **Nodemon** | 3 | Dev auto-restart |

### Architecture
- **Single Page Application** with custom hash-based routing (no React Router)
- **Browser history API** — back/forward buttons work natively
- **JWT in localStorage** — stateless auth, token sent in `Authorization: Bearer` header
- **Vite proxy** — `/api` requests forwarded to Express in dev, served directly in production
- **Idempotent schema** — `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` + `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` runs on every boot, zero downtime migrations
- **Fire-and-forget emails** — all emails use `.catch()` so a failed email never blocks the API response

## ✨ Feature Details

### 🔐 Authentication & User Management
- **Registration**: Full donor profile — name, email, password (≥ 6 chars), 11-digit phone, blood type, age, weight, gender, donation history, medical conditions, drug status
- **Auto User Code**: On registration a unique ID like `SLF-7K9QF2` is generated. Used to log in instead of email for privacy
- **Login**: Works with either the User Code or email address + password
- **JWT Tokens**: 7-day expiry, stored in `localStorage`, sent as `Authorization: Bearer` header on every protected request
- **Protected routes**: All write operations require valid JWT via `requireAuth` middleware
- **Return after login**: After logging in, the user is sent back to the exact page they came from (not always the explore page)

### 🩸 Blood Donation System
- **Post requests**: Donors in need post a request specifying blood type (O+, A-, etc.), donation type (blood / plasma / platelets / whole blood), urgency level (critical / urgent / normal), patient name, hospital, and location

## ⚙️ How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** v20 or higher
- **PostgreSQL** 14+ running locally
- **Gmail account** with a Google App Password (for email features)
- **Git**

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Aditi-Adri/SaveLife.git
cd SaveLife
2. Set up the database
Open PostgreSQL and create the database:


CREATE DATABASE savelife;
3. Configure backend environment

cd backend
cp .env.example .env    # or create .env manually
Edit backend/.env:


DATABASE_URL=postgresql://your_user:your_password@localhost:5432/savelife
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_jwt_key_here
JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d
EMAIL_USER=your.gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
CLIENT_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
PORT=4000
NODE_ENV=development
Getting a Gmail App Password: Go to your Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App Passwords. Generate a password for "Mail" and paste it (spaces are fine — the app strips them automatically).

4. Install backend dependencies and start

cd backend
npm install
npm run dev
The backend starts on http://localhost:4000. On first start it automatically runs the schema SQL and creates all tables.

5. Install frontend dependencies and start
In a new terminal:


cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
The frontend starts on http://localhost:5173. All /api requests are proxied to port 4000 automatically.

6. (Optional) Seed sample data

cd backend
npm run db:seed
This populates the database with sample donors, hospitals, doctors, ambulances, and medicines.

Production Build

cd frontend
npm run build
Then start the backend with NODE_ENV=production — it will serve the built React app from frontend/dist/.
